# ISP Media Project

---

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

This project is organized into **two main branches**:

- **frontend**: Contains all the code and documentation for the user interface.
- **backend**: Contains all the code and documentation for the server-side logic and APIs.

---

## ðŸŒ³ Branch Management

To switch between branches, use the following commands:

```sh
 git checkout frontend   # Switch to the frontend branch
 git checkout backend    # Switch to the backend branch
```

---

## ðŸ’¡ Recommended Workflow

We recommend **cloning this repository twice**:

1. **One folder for the frontend**
2. **Another folder for the backend**

This allows you to work on both parts independently and run them simultaneously if needed.

**Example:**

```sh
git clone <repo-url> ispmedia-frontend
cd ispmedia-frontend
git checkout frontend

# In a separate folder
git clone <repo-url> ispmedia-backend
cd ispmedia-backend
git checkout backend
```

## ðŸ“š In-Depth Documentation

You will find **detailed explanations, setup instructions, and usage guides** inside each branch's README file. Please refer to them for more information about running and developing each part of the project.
